# Data-Analysis-Projects
This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects showcasing my skills and experience as a Data Analyst/Scientist.
Through these projects, I have applied various data analysis techniques and utilized different machine learning algorithms, demonstrating my journey of continuous improvement and growth.

# [Poject1: 911.Calls]()

This project combines data analysis and visualization. It serves as a preliminary project, where I explore, clean, and manipulate the data.
* Data was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert?select=911.csv)
* Data Cleaning
* Data Manipulation: Variables transforming, Creating new features, Reshaping the data_time.
* Visualisation= Histogram plot, Scatter plot, Heatmap.
* Library needed : Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# [Project2:Ecommerce Customers(Linear Regression)]()

In this small project, the data was clean, which facilitated the focus on becoming familiar with the machine learning algorithm. The primary objective was to utilize the Linear Regression algorithm to develop a predictive model for solving a continuous data problem.
* Data was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Hex plot, Scatter plot, Pairplot and Linear plot.
* Training and Testing Data through Sklearn
* Evaluating the model: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error. 
# [Project3: Loan (Decision Tree/ Random Forest]()
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Trees and Random Forest. 
* Data was taken from [Kaggle]
* Data Exploratory and Visualisation: Countplot, Linear plot, Scatter plot
* Training and Testing Data through Sklearn

# [Project4: House sales(artificial neural network)]()
